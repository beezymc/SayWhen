# SayWhen! #

## Target ##
The target audience is folks who are busy with obligations and might need some help in getting some availabilities together in order to meet with friends.

## Summary ##
The product will allow users to create a basic availability chart, and allow their friends to schedule activities based on that chart in 'disposable' weekly chunks. Some key benefits are: ease of spinning up a chart and sharing it, relative freedom in setting up availability/activities, specifying user's (US-centric) timezone.

## Problem ##
As life gets more busy, it becomes difficult to schedule time with friends. Even the discussion around scheduling might be a deterrant to actually scheduling something.

## Solution ##
This app allows you to quickly spin up your availability for the week, and allows friends to add activities to that availability, thereby giving one the opportunity for quick scheduling.

## Quote from You ##
"You should never be too busy to talk over a beer."

## How to Get Started ##
Just go to the URL, type in your name, timezone, and a general schedule. Once done, you'll be redirected to the schedule, which you can then share with friends. The user or friends can then create activities based on that schedule.

## Customer Quote ##
"I used to meet my best friend once a month at best. Now with SayWhen!, we meet twice a week! It's really helped keep my close connections closer."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
Whenever you feel too busy for fun, go to saywhen.vercel.app and we'll get a plan going.
